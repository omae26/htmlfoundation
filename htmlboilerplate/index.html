<!-- You should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of your websites index.html. 
 This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on your 
 websites - and not having one will cause big problems. -->

<!-- DOCTYPE specifies the version of html used -->
<!-- html element.This is what’s known as the root element of the document, 
 meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it. -->
<!-- Lang specifies the language of the text content in that element -->
<!-- The head element is where you put important meta-information about your webpages, 
 and stuff required for your webpages to render correctly in the browser -->
<!-- The head element consists of the meta and title -->
<!-- The meta tag is for charset encoding in the webpage  -->
<!-- The title element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which 
 is displayed in your webpage’s browser tab. -->
<!-- The body element where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists,
  links, and so on. It is within the html element, and below the head element-->
